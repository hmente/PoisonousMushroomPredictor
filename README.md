# PoisonousMushroomPredictor

This is a tree predictor for binary classification that predicts whether a mushroom is poisonous or not based on its features.
Data is loaded from the [Mushroom Classification dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/848/secondary+mushroom+dataset). The dataset contains 61069 rows and 21 columns.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation and Running
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages using the following command:
```bash pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook using the following command:
```bash jupyter notebook```
4. Run each cell in the notebook to train the model and predict the class of a mushroom.

## About the model:
1. The model is trained using the Decision Tree Classifier which is created from scratch.
2. The model is evaluated using the accuracy score and the confusion matrix. 
3. The model is tested using the test data and the accuracy score is calculated.
4. The model is used to predict the class of a mushroom using the features of the mushroom.
